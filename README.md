## Overview
This repository provides a method to perform a reduction over a list of specified dimensions in an input ndarray. It uses a one-dimensional strided array reduction function to compute results and assigns them to a provided output ndarray. This functionality is essential for efficient data processing in various applications.

For the latest releases, visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/moriarty42070/ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-to-struct/releases).

## Features
- **Efficient Reduction**: Reduces ndarrays over specified dimensions.
- **Strided Array Support**: Works with one-dimensional strided arrays.
- **Output Assignment**: Assigns results directly to a specified output ndarray.
- **Flexible API**: Easy to integrate into existing JavaScript applications.

## Installation
To install the package, use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-to-struct
```

## Usage
Here is a simple example to demonstrate how to use the package:

```javascript
const reduce = require('ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-to-struct');

// Define your input ndarray
const inputArray = /* your input ndarray */;

// Define your output ndarray
const outputArray = /* your output ndarray */;

// Specify dimensions for reduction
const dimensions = [0, 1];

// Perform reduction
reduce(inputArray, outputArray, dimensions);
```

## API Documentation
### `reduce(input, output, dimensions)`
- **input**: The input ndarray to be reduced.
- **output**: The ndarray where results will be stored.
- **dimensions**: An array of dimensions to reduce.

### Example
```javascript
const input = /* your input ndarray */;
const output = /* your output ndarray */;
const dims = [0];

reduce(input, output, dims);
```

## Examples
Here are some practical examples of how to use the reduction function in different scenarios:

### Example 1: Summing Values
```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const reduce = require('ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-to-struct');

const input = ndarray(new Float32Array([1, 2, 3, 4]), [2, 2]);
const output = ndarray(new Float32Array(2), [2]);
const dims = [0];

reduce(input, output, dims);
console.log(output); // Output will be [4, 6]
```

### Example 2: Finding Maximum Values
```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const reduce = require('ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-to-struct');

const input = ndarray(new Float32Array([5, 3, 8, 1]), [2, 2]);
const output = ndarray(new Float32Array(2), [2]);
const dims = [1];

reduce(input, output, dims);
console.log(output); // Output will be [5, 8]
```
